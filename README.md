Platform Brew Docker Image
================================================================================

This repository contains Dockerfiles for running [Platform Brew][].

 * `standalone/` - Contains a Dockerfile built on sjackman/linuxbrew-standalone.
   Ultiately would like to target a stand-alone Linuxbrew variant but this isn't
   working for me yet.
 * `core/` - Contains a Dockerfile built on sjackman/linuxbrew-core - it is more
   functional currently.
